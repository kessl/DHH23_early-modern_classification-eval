# Evaluation of CLIP-based classification of eighteenth-century images (ECCO)
Quantitative and qualitative analysis of image classification results produced using a CLIP-based model. Extension of the [Early Modern group's work](https://github.com/dhh23/early_modern) during the Helsinki Digital Humanities Hackathon 2023.

## Introduction and data
The Early Modern group investigated how the intellectual, economic, and societal changes of the Enlightenment era were reflected in the use of scientific illustrations. The sample examined consisted of works aimed at eighteenth-century British audiences, collected in the Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO). Specifically, we used data from the Scientific collection, counting just over 100 000 individual pages containing illustrations.

During the Hackathon, three different image classification iterations were run, using or based on [the CLIP model](https://github.com/openai/CLIP):
1. The first run (CLIP1) ------
2. The second run [CLIP2) ------
3. The third run (CLIP3) ------. While CLIP1 and 2 both gave the top one classification prediction only, with CLIP3, we had it
provide the two highest value predictions. This 'second most likely class' in the CLIP3 data, along with ------, makes it ideal for
further analysis. --------why---------

In the Hackathon outcomes, only classification entries with min. 50% accuracy for the first candidate were included into the
analyses and subsequent interpretation. However, the accurracy span was wide in all three runs. In this task, I summarise these tendencies, verify them with close-reading, and speculate on their possible reasons and outcomes. I do this on the data about the third run (CLIP3), for several reasons:
- the data from this run also provides the second most probable category the model assigned to each entry, which can shed light on the model's behaviour with this type of a dataset
- the model used in the third run was already customised based on human-annotated feedback on the previous two runs: --- and so ---

## Research question and hypothesis
RQ: ------ Do the certainty scores in CLIP3 predictions reflect the actual categories and/or visual form of the images classified, and, if so, then what are the tendencies? What can we conclude about the performance of a model thus customised? --------
