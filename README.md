# Evaluation of eighteenth-century images (ECCO) as classified by CLIP-based models
Quantitative and qualitative analysis of image classification results produced using a CLIP-based model. Extension of the [Early Modern group's work](https://github.com/dhh23/early_modern) during the Helsinki Digital Humanities Hackathon 2023.

## Introduction and data
The Early Modern group investigated how the intellectual, economic, and societal changes of the Enlightenment era were reflected in the use of scientific illustrations. The sample examined consisted of works aimed at eighteenth-century British audiences collected in the Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO). Specifically, we used data from the Scientific collection, counting just over 100 000 individual pages containing illustrations.
